# CT-MOLE

We use MEAN.JS to initialize the full-stack framework, please following the instructions below.

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components. 

## Before You Begin 
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application: 
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), particularly [The Express Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html); you can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Downloading MEAN.JS
There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate: 

### Yo Generator 
The recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs
```
This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on github](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:
```
$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip
```
Don't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower installcommand to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Set NODE_ENV
Please set the node environment, currently supports all/development/production/test. If no NODE_ENV presets, CT-mole will use development by default.
* On Windows: SET NODE_ENV=development
* On OS X or Linux: export NODE_ENV=development

## Create MongoDB schema
Please contact cbioportal@cbio.mskcc.org for a data dump

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation.
