    <title>Phase 1 Study of MGD007 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma</title>
    <purpose>The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      MGD007 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGD007 administered on either
      weekly or every three week schedules of administration among patients with metastatic
      colorectal carcinoma. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of
      MGD007 will also be assessed.</purpose>

    <title>Irinotecan Hydrochloride With FOLFIRI and Cetuximab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With RAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer</title>
    <purpose>This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of irinotecan hydrochloride,
      based on a genetic test, when given in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium,
      and cetuximab as first-line therapy in treating patients with an abnormal gene called RAS
      wild-type that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Patients may also have a
      gene called uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) that may interfere with the
      way irinotecan hydrochloride is absorbed by the body and may not be able to tolerate it.
      Determining the presence of this gene may help determine the best dose of irinotecan
      hydrochloride when given with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium (FOLFIRI). Combination
      chemotherapy, such as FOLFIRI, works in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Cetuximab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving FOLFIRI together with cetuximab may be a better treatment for
      patients with colorectal cancer.</purpose>

    <title>FOLFIRI and Panitumumab in Treating Patients With RAS and BRAF Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</title>
    <purpose>This phase II trial studies how well fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) together with panitumumab work in treating patients with colorectal
      cancer that expresses the RAS and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF)
      wild-type genes, has spread from the original site of growth to another part of the body
      (metastatic), resists the effects of treatment with prior cetuximab (or panitumumab) plus
      irinotecan hydrochloride-based therapy, and who have failed at least one subsequent
      non-anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing treatment regimen. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      panitumumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving
      FOLFIRI together with panitumumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.</purpose>

    <title>Pembrolizumab and Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Advanced Cancer</title>
    <purpose>There will be two phase II cohorts for pembro plus trastuzumab: one cohort will be for
      patients with unresectable HER2 overexpressing gastric or GEJ cancers, the other cohort will
      be for patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The pembro plus
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine phase II arm will be for patients with HER2 overexpressing MBC.
      There will be two phase II cohorts for pembro plus cetuximab: one cohort will be for
      patients with HNSCC, the other cohort will be for patients with K-ras, B-raf, N-ras wildtype
      metastatic CRC.</purpose>
